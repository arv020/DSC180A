# DSC180A

In this project we will be running a classifier model in order to determine whether or not a video is being streamed while using a VPN. 




In order to reproduce the model, you must:

1. Open a terminal on your computer and log into the dsmlp server by using your login.
ex. ssh username@dsmlp-login.ucsd.edu

2. launch a docker container by running:
launch-180.sh -i arv020/viasat_model

3. clone the repo 

4. run the model by running 
python run.py 
or 
python run.py test (in order to run on test data)
